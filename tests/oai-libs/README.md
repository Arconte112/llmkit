# OpenAI Library Examples for LLMKit

This directory contains examples showing how to use the OpenAI client libraries (Python and Node.js) with LLMKit.

## Directory Structure

- `python/` - Python OpenAI client examples
- `nodejs/` - Node.js OpenAI client examples

## Overview

These examples demonstrate how to:

1. Connect to a local LLMKit server
2. Use various prompt types:
   - Static system prompts
   - Dynamic system prompts with template variables
   - Dynamic system and user prompts
   - JSON response format

3. Use advanced features:
   - Template variable substitution via JSON inputs
   - Streaming responses
   - Chat history/conversation
   - Function calling
   
Each directory contains language-specific implementations of similar concepts to demonstrate API compatibility with the OpenAI client libraries.
